# Apple I Emulator

This is a minimal emulator of the original Apple computer, intended as a basic sanity check of the 6502 cpu core. It automatically loads up three programs:
- The required WOZ Monitor at FF00
- BASIC at E000
- The [classic console test program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sY-gbgQl68) at 0000
